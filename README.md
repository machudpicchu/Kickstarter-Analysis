# Kickstarter-Analysis
Module 1 Challenge Assignment
# Overview of Project
Louise has asked for some data analysis regarding Kickstarter campaigns as she is planning to use Kickstarter to fund a play she hopes to produce.  As the project is nearing completion, Louise has asked for some specific data regarding how Kickstarter campaigns from the category Theater and how they fared based on when they were launched.  She also asked for data around the outcomes for plays specifically and how many were successful when compared to the size of the goal set for the campaign.
# Analysis and Challenges
## Analysis
To analyze this data, two spread sheets were pulled from the large data set.  To determine the Theater Outcomes by Launch Dates, a pivot chart was created in Excel that filtered the results by the parent category "Theater" with the possibility of filtering the results by year.  I then made the pivot chart to compare how many campaigns were Successful, Failed, or Cancelled based on the month in which the campaign was launched.  I then converted the chart into a Line chart that compared the number of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns.  The graph is included in the submission.  A second chart was made by making a chart that counted the number of campaigns based on the amount of the goals set.  These included less than 1,000 dollars, 1,000 to 4,9999 dollars, 5,000 to 9,9999 dollars, 10,000 to 14,999 dollars, 15,000 to 19,999 dollars, 20,000 to 24,999 dollars, 25,000 to 29,999 dollars, 30,000 to 34,999 dollars, 35,000 to 39,999 dollars, 40,000 to 44,999 dollars, 45,000 to 49,999 dollars, and 50,000 dollars or greater.  These results were then filtered using the COUNTIFS function to filter only for Plays, and then to compare Successful, Failed, and Cancelled campaigns.  A line graph was then created to compare the data.  ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png](filename)
## Challenges
The challenge for me in completing this project came from the time it took me to write the code using the COUNTIFS function.  It took me a long time to get the initial formula correct.  After that, I quickly populated other categories based on the values of the inequalities, only to realize that I needed to go back and add the dollar sign "$" to the formulas to correctly move the formula across cells in Excel.  When I went to compare those corrected results, I found mine were signicantly different because I had not filtered for plays, which led to having to tweak all of the cells again.  This all is part of the learning curve, but it was my greatest challenge for this project. 
# Results
## Conclusions About Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
The most important conclusion drawn from the data regarding the launch date is that May is far and away the most common month for successful Kickstarter campaigns in the category of theater.  This month was the clear peak in the trend with 111 successful campaigns, with June a distant second with 100.  The next closest is July with 87 successful campaigns in the theater category.
The second conclusion is that May also has the highest number of failed campaigns; however, it is not as disproportionately high as the success rate for that month as its score is 52 failed campaigns.  July and October both had fifty failed campaigns, and the rest of the months vary between 31 and 49.  
This would mean that while May has both the greatest chance of success and the greatest chance of failure, the chance of success is disproportionately higher in this month while the chance of failure is not as disproportionately high.
## Conclusion About Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on this information, the highest percentage of campaigns for plays were launched with a goal of less than $1,000.  The second highest percentage came from plays with goals of $1,000 to $4,999.  Both of these numbers make sense as they are the smallest options and also where the majority of the campaigns in this category were launched.  On contrast, the total number of successful and failed campaigns at all other launch amounts was 158, which is far less than the 720 successful and failed projects launched with a goal of $4,999 or less.  So while this does mean that a smaller goal has a considerably better chance of being successful, there is also less data above a $5,000 goal to accurately compare.  That said, plays with a goal of $35,000 to $44,999 had the next highest success rate of 67%.
## Limitations and Recommendations
### Limitations
The biggest limitation for this data set is that the most recent campaigns come from 2017.  Every year since 2020 and the advent of COVID have been their own case study in consumer practices, and this data would be no different.  Updating the data to include 2021 and 2022 would make this much more relevant for Louise or anyone attempting to create a Kickstarter campaign.  
### Recommendations
The main recommendation for additional charts and graphs from this data would be to more deeply examine the options listed for "Spotlight" and "Staff Pick."  I would want to examine the data to see if there is any correlation between either of those two distinctions and success rates to see if they are worth pursuing.  I would create a bar chart that compares success rates for all projects, theater projects, and plays specifically, and then compare the results of the three that were staff picks, spotlights, and neither to see if the success rates were greater.
